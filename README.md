# Iris_detection_using_KNN
The "Iris Flower Species Detection using KNN Model" is a machine learning project in python designed to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The project leverages the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

#Project Goals:

Data Collection: The project begins with the collection of a well-known dataset called the "Iris dataset." This dataset consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing is a critical step in any machine learning project. In this project, we will explore the dataset, handle missing data (if any), and ensure that the data is properly formatted for training and testing the KNN model.

Feature Selection: We will choose the appropriate features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) that have the most significant influence on the classification task.

Model Development: The core of the project involves implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. We will train the KNN model using a portion of the dataset and tune hyperparameters such as the number of neighbors (K) to achieve the best possible accuracy.

Model Evaluation: We will evaluate the KNN model's performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques will be applied to ensure robustness of the model.

Visualization: To gain a better understanding of the results, the project will include data visualization techniques. Visualizations may include scatter plots, confusion matrices, and decision boundaries.

Prediction: Once the KNN model is trained and evaluated, it will be ready to make predictions on new, unseen data. Users can input iris measurements, and the model will classify the iris flower into one of the three species.
